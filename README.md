# SalaryPrediction

This is the salary prediction from job description.

The original data contains the features: job id, company id, job type, degree, major, industry, years of experience, miles from metropolis.  
With using these features, I made a model for predicting the salary.  
If we obtain a new job description, we can predict the salary for this new job with using this model.

## About the dataset

This data set looks like this.
![dataset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5339011/81498700-63647600-9301-11ea-8f5b-705ba2336d2f.png)
From this image, we can see some numerical variables and categorical variables.
We have the numerical features: companyId, yearsExperience,	milesFromMetropolis,
and categorical features: jobId, jobType, degree, major,	industry.

## Data cleaning

The original data didn't contain NaN or strange value.
Some of the job has 0 salary and I removed the ones.

## Exploring the data

The distribution of salary looks like the graph below.

We can see a long tail on the right side.

There are two numerical variable; years of experience, miles from metropolis.

From this table, you can see salary is positively correlated with years of experience and negatively correlated with miles from metropolis.

Also, I checked the relationships between salary and job type, degree, major and company id.
These graphs are the mean salary vs. job type, degree, major and company id.

Accoding to the means of categorical features, jobType and degrees are correlated with salary stronger than major and companyId.

## Establish a baseline
For the baseline, I decided to predict the salary only by the years of experience.
I used the ```LinearRegresson ``` to make a model
The MSE for this model is 1288.

## Hypothesize solution

I used all the features without companyId and encoded the categorical value.
Then I use these methods: Linear Regression, Gradient boosting and Random forest regressor.

## Develop
For all the model, the first trial MSEs are listed below.
Std means the standard deviation of MSE.
| Model  | MSE | Std  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Linear regression  | 384  | 1.78 |
| Gradient boosting  | 375  | 1.82 |
| Random forest  | 466  | 1.50 |

Now Gradient boosting is the best.

## Turning Gradient boosting model
I tried tuning the number of estimators.

| # of estimators | MSE | Std |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 100 (default)  | 375  | 1.82 |
| 200  | 359  | 1.44 |
| 1000  | 355  | 1.45 |

When the number of estimators is 200 or 1000, the MSE is lower than 360.

## feature importance
Using the gradient boosting model with n_estimators=200, I checked the features importance.
Ignoring the categorical value, years of experience and miles from metropolis are the important features.
