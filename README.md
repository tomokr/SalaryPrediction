# SalaryPrediction

This is the salary prediction from job description.

The original data contains the features: job id, company id, job type, degree, major, industry, years of experience, miles from metropolis.
With using these features, I made a model for predicting the salary.

## Data cleaning

The original data didn't contain NaN or strange value.
Some of the job has 0 salary and I removed the ones.

## Exploring the data

There are two numerical variable; years of experience, miles from metropolis.
