# SalaryPrediction

This is the salary prediction from job description.

The original data contains the features: job id, company id, job type, degree, major, industry, years of experience, miles from metropolis.
With using these features, I made a model for predicting the salary.

## Data cleaning

The original data didn't contain NaN or strange value.
Some of the job has 0 salary and I removed the ones.

## Exploring the data

There are two numerical variable; years of experience, miles from metropolis.

From this table, you can see salary is positively correlated with years of experience and negatively correlated with miles from metropolis.

Also, I checked the relationships between salary and job type, degree, major and company id.
These graphs are the mean salary vs. job type, degree, major and company id.

Accoding to the means of categorical features, jobType and degrees are correlated with salary stronger than major and companyId.
